            When engineering teams and cloud architects design solutions
            across AWS environments, they need real-time visibility into
            service availability across regions. This is the story of how
            strategic planning, modular serverless architecture, and
            AI-assisted development came together to create a production-ready
            monitoring platform—written 100% with Claude Code.

          <h2>The Challenge: AWS Service Discovery at Scale</h2>

          <p>
            As organizations expand their AWS footprint across multiple
            accounts and regions, a common challenge emerges: How do you
            quickly confirm which services are available in specific regions?
            When designing new solutions or planning migrations, cloud
            architects and engineers need instant answers to questions like:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Is AWS AppSync available in ap-southeast-3 for our new project?
            </li>
            <li>
              Which regions support Amazon Bedrock for our AI initiative?
            </li>
            <li>
              What&apos;s our current service distribution across all AWS accounts?
            </li>
            <li>How has our infrastructure footprint changed over time?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Traditional approaches involve manually checking AWS documentation
            or running CLI commands across multiple accounts—time-consuming
            and error-prone. We needed a real-time, visual solution that could
            aggregate this data automatically.
          </p>

          <h2>The Solution: Real-Time AWS Service Discovery and Visualization</h2>

          <p>

          <h2>Modular Architecture: The Key to Managing Complexity</h2>

          <p>
            Here&apos;s where the real learning happened. The project is split into
            four independent repositories, each with a clear separation of
            responsibilities. This modular approach combined with AWS
            serverless services creates a scalable, maintainable system:
          </p>

          <h3>1. aws-services-site (Frontend Dashboard)</h3>
          <p>
            The React-based user interface responsible solely for displaying
            data and user interactions. No backend logic, no data collection—
            just a clean, focused presentation layer.
          </p>

          <h3>2. aws-infrastructure-fetcher (Data Collection)</h3>
          <p>
            A Lambda function that runs on a schedule via EventBridge. Its
            single responsibility: fetch service data from AWS APIs and store
            it in S3. No UI concerns, no reporting logic.
          </p>

          <h3>3. nodejs-aws-reporter (Excel Report Generation)</h3>
          <p>
            An independent Node.js service that reads S3 data and generates
            formatted Excel reports. Completely isolated from the dashboard
            and data collection logic.
          </p>

          <h3>4. synepho-s3cf-site (Infrastructure Provisioning)</h3>
          <p>
            Terraform configurations that provision all AWS resources: S3
            buckets, CloudFront distributions, Lambda functions, IAM roles,
            and more. Infrastructure concerns separated from application code.
          </p>

          <h3>Serverless Architecture Benefits</h3>
          <p>
            By leveraging AWS serverless services (Lambda, S3, EventBridge,
            CloudFront), this architecture provides:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Zero server management</strong> - No EC2 instances to
              patch or maintain
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Automatic scaling</strong> - Handles traffic spikes
              without configuration
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pay-per-use pricing</strong> - Only pay for actual
              execution time
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Built-in high availability</strong> - AWS manages
              redundancy and failover
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Global distribution</strong> - CloudFront CDN delivers
              content worldwide
            </li>
          </ul>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Breaking the project into these
              distinct modular components wasn&apos;t just good architecture—it was
              essential for successful AI-assisted development. Each
              repository became a manageable, focused context that Claude Code
              could understand and work with effectively.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <h2>The AI Development Workflow: Plan First, Code Second</h2>

          <p>
            Every line of code in this project was written by Claude Code. But
            here&apos;s the crucial lesson I learned: AI agents are eager to help
            and quick to write code. Ask &quot;Write me an application to do X&quot; and
            you&apos;ll get code immediately. However, as projects grow complex,
            this approach leads to challenges:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Context overload</strong> - AI agents struggle when too
              much code exists in one place
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tangled dependencies</strong> - Changes become risky and
              unpredictable
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Lost in complexity</strong> - The AI can&apos;t maintain
              mental models of large codebases
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Regression risks</strong> - Updates break seemingly
              unrelated features
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Deployment nightmares</strong> - Monolithic codebases
              are hard to deploy incrementally
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Better Approach: Design Sessions Before Code Sessions</h3>

          <p>
            Instead of rushing to code, I spent significant time upfront on
            planning and design with Claude Code:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Define clear boundaries</strong> - What does each
              service do? What doesn&apos;t it do?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Map data flows</strong> - How does information move
              between services?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Establish contracts</strong> - What are the API
              interfaces and data formats?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Plan infrastructure</strong> - What AWS resources do we
              need and why?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Design for deployment</strong> - How will changes be
              tested and rolled out?
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Only after these design sessions did we start writing code. And
            the difference was remarkable:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Focused coding sessions</strong> - Each repository was a
              contained, manageable task
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Clearer instructions</strong> - I could give precise
              direction within defined boundaries
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Easier troubleshooting</strong> - Issues were isolated
              to specific services
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Confident changes</strong> - Updates in one repo didn&apos;t
              risk breaking others
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Independent deployments</strong> - Services could be
              updated on their own schedule
            </li>
          </ul>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When working with AI coding
              assistants, resist the urge to get code immediately. Spend time
              on design. The more complex your project, the more critical this
              upfront investment becomes.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <h2>Lessons from Traditional Software Development Still Apply</h2>

          <p>
            This experience reinforced a fundamental truth: whether you&apos;re
            working with AI agents or traditional development teams, the best
            projects have strong upfront planning and design sessions.
          </p>

          <p>
            In traditional teams, you&apos;d never start a complex project without:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Architecture reviews</li>
            <li>Design documents</li>
            <li>API contracts</li>
            <li>Data flow diagrams</li>
            <li>Deployment strategies</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The same principles apply to AI-assisted development. The AI is
            your pair programmer, not a magic solution that eliminates the
            need for good software engineering practices.
          </p>

          <h2>Key Takeaways for Your AI-Assisted Projects</h2>

          <p>
            If you&apos;re working with AI coding assistants on complex projects,
            here are my recommendations:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Design before coding</strong> - Spend significant time
              on architecture and planning
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Break it down</strong> - Split complex systems into
              focused, modular components
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Define clear boundaries</strong> - Each component should
              have a single, well-defined responsibility
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Document interfaces</strong> - API contracts and data
              formats are critical
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Resist quick code</strong> - Just because AI can write
              code quickly doesn&apos;t mean it should
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Maintain context size</strong> - Keep individual
              codebases manageable for AI comprehension
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Apply traditional practices</strong> - Good software
              engineering principles still matter
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Production Results</h2>

          <p>The numbers speak for themselves:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
